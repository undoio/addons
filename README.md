UDB Addons
==========

A collection of add-on scripts and configuration to enhance the functionality

Summary
-------

[**Automatic symbol loading**](automatic_symbol_loading/README.md)
Loads all debug files in the specified directory.

[**Backtrace with time**](backtrace_with_time/README.md)
Adds a ubt command which adds basic block counts to frames within a backtrace.

[**Completion**](completion/README.md)
Adds completion of udb command line parameters in bash.

[**Count calls**](count_calls/README.md)
Counts how many times each function was called in the specificed period of time.

[**Follow fork**](follow_fork/README.md)
Allows live-record to record both parent and child after `fork()` has been called.

[**LiveRecorder in Kubernetes**](k8s_live_recorder/README.md)
A demo of how to record an application in a Kubernetes pod using live-record.

[**Load Debug Symbols**](load_debug_symbols/README.md)
Loads debug symbols by parsing the relevant section addresses.

[**Reconstruct file**](reconstruct_file/README.md)
Reconstructs the content of a file by analysing reads on the execution history
of a debugged program or LiveRecorder recording.

[**Regs every bb**](regs_every_bb/README.md)
Prints the values of all the registers at every basic block within a range.

[**Relative wallclock**](relative_wallclock/README.md)
Prints an approximate wallclock time relative to the start of recording.

[**Reverse step map**](reverse_step_map/README.md)
Executes a reverse-step-instruction, prints the instruction and, for each
register used in it, prints which map is involved.

[**Sample functions**](sample_functions/README.md)
Samples the number of times the program is in each function.

[**What map**](what_map/README.md)
