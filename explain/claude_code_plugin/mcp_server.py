# Undo Recordings

Undo Recordings are self-contained files that capture the complete execution history of a program
in a form that can be replayed by UDB (the debugger part of the Undo Suite) and by this MCP server
(which uses UDB).

Recordings typically have the file extension `.undo`, but that's not a requirement. You can create
recordings using the `record` MCP tool, but the user may also already have recordings they generated
in other ways.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Recordings are opaque binary files.
- You MUST never try to open or parse a recording yourself.
- If a file has `.undo` extension, you MUST assume it's a recording, so you MUST use the provided MCP
  tools to investigate it - don't try to parse it.
- Once you have a recording, you MUST use the provided MCP tools to debug it.
- Never try to invoke UDB directly as it can be controlled by this MCP server.
- Don't try to use GDB on the recordings as GDB doesn't support them.
- As recordings contain the complete execution history of a program, you MUST NOT re-run the program
  to obtain information that is already available in a recording. Re-running the program may lead to
  different behaviour.

You may see recordings referred as "Undo recordings", "LiveRecorder recordings", "LR recordings",
"UDB recordings", or "UndoDB recordings". These are all the same, but when talking about recordings
to users you MUST always use the term "Undo recordings" or just "recordings" to avoid confusion.

    Record the execution of a program using live-record to create an Undo recording.

    This tool captures the complete execution history of a program, including all function
    calls, variable values, control flow, and system interactions. The resulting recording
    can be debugged using the available MCP tools or UDB directly.

    Once a recording reproducing an issue is generated, you should not re-run the program to
    investigate its behaviour as the recording already contains all the state you need.
    Re-running the program may lead to different behaviour and make debugging more difficult.
