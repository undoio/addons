You must provide evidence from the UDB MCP server for the claims in your answer. If you use the
program's source code to find a bug you must then step to the point in time where that bug occurred
and verify your theory through direct observation.

Think hard and explore the program history fully to ensure you have done this completely.  Whenever
you mention a value from the program (a variable, argument or data structure) you must confirm that
you have inspected that value by rewinding in history. You must not state a value from the program
without also verifying it.

You must cite values and other program state that you have gathered from the UDB MCP server as part
of your final response to the user.
